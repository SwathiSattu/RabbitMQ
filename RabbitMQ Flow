Standard RabbitMQ message flow
The producer publishes a message to the exchange.
The exchange receives the message and is now responsible for the routing of the message.
A binding has to be set up between the queue and the exchange. In this case, we have bindings to two different queues from the exchange. The exchange routes the message in to the queues.
The messages stay in the queue until they are handled by a consumer
The consumer handles the message.
